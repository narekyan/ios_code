Hi

Here you can see ios test solution
I used xcode 12.5.1. didnt used 3rd party libs.
Here you can see swift, combine, mvvm + services, coordinator, di.
Here Repository class is connecter between server codable objects and domain objects.
In different places I used different ways just to show some alternatives.
You can see some ui from storyboard, some ui from code, 
some viewmodel as struct, some viewmodel as pure fucntion.
I wrote some ram caching service.
You can see some unit tests.
